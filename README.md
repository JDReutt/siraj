brushing up on ML tutorials for interview prep with the help of Siraj Raval https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A

## Content of this repository will be mainly sourced by Siraj Raval's lectures
I will likely provide some of my own examples and experiments and I make no guarantees that this code will run and it will probably be full of spaces instead of tabs because ### haskell made me do it 

If you stumble upon this repo, I strongly urge you to go to the source and just work from scratch from his videos. If you find this useful ("Oh Joe your code is so dreamy" Or "I've never seen such elaborate antipatterns, they're magnificent!") I'm glad you do and make sure to give proper attribution to Siraj for his hard work.

Give him a follow at @llSourcell https://github.com/llSourcell 

Oh and no suing me.
